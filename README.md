# PSU\_2017\_nmobjdump

## Project
Epitech 2nd year project.

The goal of this project is to code a my\_nm program with the exact same beahaviour as the *nm* system
command, and an *my\_objdump* program with the exact same behaviour as the objdump -f -s system command.




## Prerequisites
There's no prequisites to run the project.



## How to use it
To use these programs, you first need to compile it using the makefile :

To compile both :    

    make re && make clean

To compile only one :
    
    make nm && make clean
    make objdump && make clean

Then, just launch it :

    ./nm [file]
    ./objdump [file]
